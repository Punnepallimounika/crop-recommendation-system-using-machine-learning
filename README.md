# crop-recommendation-system-using-machine-learning
Crop recommendation using machine learning involves using algorithms and models to predict the most suitable crops for a specific region or farm based on factors such as N,P,K,Ph,Humidity,Rainfall,Temperature.Here we used NAIVE BAYES CLASSIFIER algorithm to predict the crop.
